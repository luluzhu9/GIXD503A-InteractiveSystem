    <h1>Interactive System with UI</h1>
    <p>
      I started with Maxim's tutorial on an environment with flies and built on that by adding a frog that eats 
      the flies it comes into contact with. The user can also control the frog's range by inputting a value in
      the text box at the top left of the page. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I was able to achieve this by referencing the lecture, looking at examples of how other people worked with object-oriented 
      programming on openprocessing.org, and reading p5.js's documentation.
